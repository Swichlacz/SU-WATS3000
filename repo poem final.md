 *By John Keats*
 
Pensive they sit, and roll their *languid* eyes, <br>
Nibble their toast, and cool their tea with sighs,<br>
Or else forget the purpose of the night,<br>
Forget their tea, forget their appetite.<br>
See with cross'd arms they sit, ah! happy crew,<br>
The fire is going out and no one rings<br>
For coals, and therefore no coals Betty brings.<br>
A fly is in the milk-pot, must he **die**<br>
By a humane society?<br>
No, no; there Mr. Werter takes his spoon,<br>
Inserts it, dips the handle, and lo! soon<br>
The little straggler, sav'd from perils dark,<br>
Across the teaboard draws a long wet mark.<br>
Arise! take snuffers by the handle,<br>
There's a large cauliflower in each candle.<br>
A winding-sheet, ah me! I must away<br>
To No. 7, just beyond the circus gay.<br>
'Alas, my friend! your coat sits very well;<br>
Where may your tailor live?'    'I may not tell.<br>
O pardon me, I'm absent now and then.<br>
Where might my tailor live?    I say again<br>
I cannot tell, let me no more be _teaz'd_,<br>
He lives in Wapping, might live where he _pleas'd_.'<br>
